# [Mastering reactive programing course](https://www.udemy.com/rxdotnet/learn/v4/overview)
This course covers Reactive Extensions, a technology for working with streams of data in a reactive fashion. With Reactive Extensions, you can ingest, filter analyze and re-broadcast data streams. You can also build your own components which generate reactive streams for others to produce.

## Topics Covered
- The reactive paradigm and push collections
- Key Rx operators
- Rx's Subject classes that help working with observable sequences
- Fundamental Stream Operators
- Advanced Stream Operators, including operations on multiple streams

## Learing Outcomes
- Understand the use of reactive sequences
- Appreciate key observable/observer .NET interfaces and how to use them
- Efficiently use Subject classes for setting up simple scenarios
- Apply single-stream operators, including operators involving time
- Apply advanced operators, including multi-stream operators
